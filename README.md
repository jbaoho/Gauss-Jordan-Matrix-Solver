# Gauss-Jordan-Matrix-Solver

The purpose of the Gauss-Jordan program is to solve a system of equations
that can be represented as an n x n matrix A with solutions in the form of a column vector.
The program relies on the fact that there exists a unique solution to the system. The program
uses Gauss-Jordan Elimination to determine row reduce each row of the augmented matrix Ax = b
to transform A into the identity matrix and x into the solutions x1, x2, ...

The Gauss-Jordan program utilizes the Java Scanner library.
